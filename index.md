**Last updated:** January 30, 2026

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how **Kien** ("we," "our," or "the App") collects, uses, stores, and protects your information when you use our mobile and web application (the "Service"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

By using Kien, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the Service.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information You Provide

- **Account information:** When you create an account, we collect your email address, a password (stored securely by our authentication provider), and an optional username. If you sign in with Google, we receive your email address and display name from Google.
- **Profile information:** Your username and email are stored in your user profile and may be visible to other users of the Service for profile and discovery features.
- **User-generated content:** When you use the Service, you may create and store data such as device entries ("seki"), wants, notes, and related information. This content is associated with your account and may be readable by other users in accordance with the App’s functionality (e.g., public profiles and explore features).

### 2.2 Information Stored Automatically

- **Local preferences:** We store certain preferences on your device only, such as theme (light/dark mode) and last-selected options (e.g., device type). This data is stored locally and is not sent to our servers for the purpose of identifying you.
- **Authentication and usage data:** Our infrastructure and third-party providers (see Section 4) may process identifiers necessary to operate the Service, such as account identifiers and session information.

### 2.3 Reports and Moderation

If you submit a report (e.g., for user-generated content), we store information necessary to process the report, including your user identifier as the reporter. Report data is used only for moderation and compliance purposes.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Create and manage your account and authenticate you.
- Provide, maintain, and improve the Service, including features such as profiles, device tracking, and explore functionality.
- Store and sync your user-generated content (e.g., seki and wants) across your devices when you are signed in.
- Allow you to export or import your data (e.g., in CSV or XLSX format) and to share exported data via your device’s sharing capabilities.
- Process reports and enforce our policies.
- Comply with applicable law and protect our rights and the safety of users.

We do not use your personal information for advertising or for selling your data to third parties.

## 4. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing

Kien relies on the following types of third-party services:

- **Firebase (Google):** We use Firebase for authentication (Firebase Auth), cloud database (Cloud Firestore), and related infrastructure. Data you provide (e.g., email, username, seki, wants) is stored and processed by Google in accordance with their terms and privacy policy.  
  [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- **Google Sign-In:** If you choose to sign in with Google, Google will process your sign-in and share with us the information you consent to (e.g., email, name).  
  [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

We do not sell your personal information. We may disclose your information only: (a) to service providers who assist in operating the Service under strict confidentiality; (b) when required by law or to protect rights and safety; or (c) in connection with a merger, sale, or transfer of assets, with notice where required by law.

---

## 5. Data Visibility and Public Content

Certain data in Kien is designed to be visible to other users to support social and discovery features:

- **User profiles** (e.g., username and associated profile information) can be read by other users.
- **Seki** (device entries) and **wants** that you create may be readable by other users in line with the App’s explore and profile features.

By using these features, you acknowledge that this information may be seen by others. Do not include sensitive personal data in fields that are shared in this way.

---

## 6. Data Retention and Deletion

- **Active account:** We retain your account and user-generated content for as long as your account is active and in line with our operational needs.
- **Account deletion:** When you request account deletion through the in-app option, we delete your user document, your seki and wants data, and your Firebase Authentication account. This process is intended to remove your data from our systems; deletion may take a short time to propagate. After deletion, we do not retain copies for longer than necessary for backups and legal obligations.
- **Local data:** Data stored only on your device (e.g., theme preference) remains until you uninstall the App or clear app data.

---

## 7. Data Security

We use industry-standard practices to protect your data, including:

- Secure authentication (e.g., Firebase Auth) and access controls so only you (and, where intended, other users) can access your content as designed.
- Firestore security rules so that only authorized operations are allowed (e.g., you can create, update, and delete only your own data).
- Reliance on Firebase/Google infrastructure and its security and compliance measures.

No method of transmission or storage is completely secure. We encourage you to use a strong, unique password and to keep your login details confidential.

---

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- **Access** the personal data we hold about you.
- **Correct** inaccurate data (e.g., via profile or account settings where available).
- **Delete** your data by deleting your account through the in-app account deletion feature.
- **Export** your data using the in-app export feature (e.g., CSV or XLSX).
- **Object or restrict** certain processing where applicable by law.

To exercise these rights or ask questions, contact us using the details in Section 10. If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, or other regions with similar laws, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

## 9. Children’s Privacy

Kien is not directed at children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.

---

## 10. International Transfers

Your information may be processed in countries where our service providers (including Google) operate. Those countries may have different data protection laws. We rely on appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses or adequacy decisions) where required by law for such transfers.

---

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will indicate changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top and, where appropriate, by notifying you through the App or by email. Your continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
